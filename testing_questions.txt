Merge 2 columns from a single Dataframe in Pandas

I want to merge 2 columns of the same dataframe, but by using some specific condition. consider the following dataframe : The conditions are: If the Number-first column has a alphanumeric value and the Number-second Column has a Nan value or a '' (empty string) -> the Result column should only consider the value from Number-first If the Number-first column has a Nan or '' (empty string) value and the Number-second Column has a alphanumeric value -> the Result column should only consider the value from Number-second If the values from both the columns are alphanumeric the result column should consist of value from Number-first and Number-second, which are separated by a '-' If both the Columns have Nan or empty string values, the result should consist of a '' (empty string) value Following would be the output for the above dataframe: I have been unsuccessful using the .select method and providing the above conditions.

How do I merge two dictionaries in a single expression (take union of dictionaries)?

I want to merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary. Using x.update(y) modifies x in-place instead of creating a new dictionary. I also want the last-one-wins conflict-handling of dict.update() as well.

How to autowire a ResourceHandlerRegistry bean not found on application startup

We've recently updated an application with a configuration class that uses the ResourceHandlerRegistry class explained here The application starts up fine in IntelliJ but when packaged into a JAR and run from the command line, startup fails because of this error: IntelliJ also highlights that it cannot find an autowire candidate for the bean. We are using Spring Boot v2.3.12.RELEASE and Spring v5.2.15.RELEASE. Any help is welcome.
